# Dev Setup and Actions

## Prerequisites
1. Docker.
2. Visual Studio Code.

## Initial Setup
1. Clone the repo.  
```
git clone https://github.com/Stewartarmbrecht/my-sample.git
```
2. Open in Visual Studio.
```
cd my-sample
code .
```
3. Edit the forwarding ports for container.  In the .devcontainer/devcontainer.json change the block below so that the IP Address matches the IP address of your machine.
```
		"10.24.1.57:8381:8381",
		"10.24.1.57:9388:9388",
		"10.24.1.57:9389:9389",
		"10.24.1.57:19300:19300",
		"10.24.1.57:19301:19301",
		"10.24.1.57:19302:19302",
		"10.24.1.57:19306:19306"
```

3. Open in Dev Container
```
Cntrl+Shift+P
"Reopen in Container"
```
4. After the container is built and you are in, run npm install.
```
npm install
```

## Running the App
To run the app you need to export the ip address of your machine then start the app.  This command will start the app in web mode:

```
export REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=10.24.1.57; npx nx start my-app --web --port=19300
```

# NX generated readme...
## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
