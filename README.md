# Solution Architecture


## Objectives
Below are the objectives that drove the design of this solution.
1. **Universal App (Mobile, Web, and eventually TV)** - This app uses Expo to enable using a single code base to deploy mobile, web, and tv apps.

2. **Offline First** - This app should be capable of running offline as well as online with realtime updates streaming to the app when updates are made in other apps.

3. **Container Based Development** - The development environment is setup to run in a Docker container.

4. **Scalable Development Model** - The solution is designed to support the deployment of multiple environments that would be useful for a team based development model.  This includes individual development environments, preview environments that can be used for external user testing, and a production environment.

5. **Concept to Cash** - While not achieved yet, ultimately the goal is to setup this repo as a starting point that provides a complete development pipeline for you.  Designed to handle standard flows for:
    1. Initial Environment Setup for Local Dev, Preview, and Production
    2. Local development, testing, and debugging
    2. Source Control Management <-- Not Added Yet
    2. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment <-- Not Added Yet
    3. Production Monitoring <-- Not Added Yet
    4. Collecting Payments <-- Not Added Yet


## Project Technologies

1. **IDE - VS Code** - The development environment was built assuming the user is using VS Code.  While we have avoided using VS Code specific flows (like using VS Code tasks for development activities), we have not explicitly designed the code base or tested it to see if the flows work outside of VS Code.  Instructions on performing setup activities will assume you are working in VS Code.

2. **Containerization - Docker** - Used to enable setting up development environments across multiple platforms: Windows, Mac, or Linux.

3. **Source Code - Git** - Used for source control with remotes hosted on GitHub.

4. **Monorepo - Nx** - Used for manage aspects of working in a monorepo. 

5. **Type Safety - TypeScript** - Used to provide type saftey.

6. **Development Framework - Expo** - Used to provide the universal app development model.

7. **Mobile Framework - React Native** - Foundation for mobile app development.

8. **Transpilation - Babel** - Used for transpiling typescript.

9. **Bundling - Metro** - Used for bundling the web and mobile app.

10. **Static Code Analysis - ESLint & Prettier** - 

11. **Mobile Builds and Deployments - EAS** - Expo's EAS services are used to build and deploy IOS and Andriod mobile apps.

12. **Backend, Web Hosting, & Offline Storage - Amplify** - Used for providing backend services for authentication and data sync.  This also includes enabling offline storage on both mobile and web.

# SETUP 
## SOURCE CODE REPOSITORY
Our approach for establishing the full development ecosystem for your solution starts first with setting up a repository to store you code.
1. Setup GitHub Account.
2. Fork template repo.

<br>
<br>

## FIRST DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

### INSTALL PREREQUISITES
1. Install Docker.
2. Install Visual Studio Code.

### PERSONALIZE SOLUTION
1. Clone the repo.  
```
git clone https://github.com/Stewartarmbrecht/my-sample.git
```
2. Open in Visual Studio.
```
cd my-sample
code .
```
3. Make the following find and replacements to update the solution to your desired setup:
    1. **IP Address** - ```10.24.1.57 -> [Your Host IP]``` - To enable connectivity from physical devices to your Metro bundler you need to forward traffic from your host machines IP to your development container.
    2. **Organization Identifier** - ```stewartarmbrecht -> [Your Company Domain]``` - This updates the app.config.ts to deploy the mobile app using an bundle identifier that will be associated with your company. 

### CREATE DEVELOPMENT CONTAINER
3. Edit the forwarding ports for container.  In the .devcontainer/devcontainer.json change the block below so that the IP Address matches the IP address of your machine.
You can also change the port numbers that you want to use.

This is the only way I have found to host your dev environment in a docker container (on a Windows machine) and access it from a physical device.
```
		"10.24.1.57:8381:8381",
		"10.24.1.57:9388:9388",
		"10.24.1.57:9389:9389",
		"10.24.1.57:19300:19300", // Used for serving the javascript bundler.
		"10.24.1.57:19301:19301", // Used for Metro Bundler
		"10.24.1.57:19302:19302", // Used by Expo DevTools.
		"10.24.1.57:19306:19306"
```
4. Edit the my-app nx start target port and ip option in the my-app project:
In apps/my-app/project.json change the start port ("19700") and the export-ip address ("10.24.1.57") options shown below to the port and ip address that your docker dev container is using:
```
{
  ...
  "targets": {
    "start": {
      "executor": "@nx/expo:start",
      "dependsOn": ["ensure-symlink", "sync-deps", "export-ip"],
      "options": {
        "port": 19700,
        "web": true
      }
    },
    "export-ip": {
      "executor": "nx:run-commands",
      "options": {
        "command": "export REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=10.24.1.57;"
      }
    },
	...
	},
  ...
}
```

4. Open in Dev Container
```
Cntrl+Shift+P
"Reopen in Container"
```

### INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

1. Run npm Install.  After the container is built and you are in, run npm install.
```
npm install
```

### SETUP AMPLIFY
1. Create Amazon account if you don't already have one:  [Sign Up for AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=header_signup&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start/email)
2. Initialize Amplify
You need to initialize amplify to create some local files so that you can run the app.
Note: if amplify is not recognized as a command I have found that rebuilding the container will fix this.  Just press Cntrl+Shift+P and them type Rebuild Container and select the Dev Container command.
```
cd libs/my-backend
amplify init
```
* **Environment Name:** dev
* **Default Editor:** Visual Studio Code
* **Authentication:** AWS Profile
* **New User:** Yes
If you get this error then just click the link to manually open the console.  Hit enter after you log in.
```
Sign in to your AWS administrator account:
https://console.aws.amazon.com/
Press Enter to continue
Unable to open https://console.aws.amazon.com/: spawn xdg-open ENOENT
Have you installed `xdg-utils` on your machine?
```
* **Region:** Your choice.
* **Amplify CLI User:** Click the link and follow the instructions to set a user that your Amplify CLI will use to connect to AWS.  Set a name that will help you identify the cli running in your dev container.  If you are connecting to a shared AWS account consider adding a name like:  mySolutionBackend-<userName>
* **accessKeyId:** Copied from access key created in instructions provided.
* **secretAccessKey:** Copied from access key created in instructions provided.
* **Profile Name:** (default)
* **Profile to Use:** default

GETTING ERROR:
```
node âžœ /workspaces/my-sample/libs/my-backend (master) $ amplify init
Note: It is recommended to run this command from the root of your app directory
? Do you want to use an existing environment? Yes
? Choose the environment you would like to use: dev
Using default provider  awscloudformation
âœ– Initializing your environment: dev
âœ– There was an error initializing your environment.
ðŸ›‘ Could not initialize platform for 'dev': Access Denied
```

```
amplify add env <your env name>
```
Replace \<your env name\> with your own name.  Unfortunately "dev" is already taken and will cause an error if you try to use it.  Please use a different name than "dev".

* Are you sure you want to continue? Yes
* Do you want to update code for your updated GraphQL API? No

... To be continued.

### RUN WEB APP

1. Run the app to verify the setup.
To run the app you need to export the ip address of your machine and set the port for the javascript bundle to the value you set above then start the app.  This command will start the app in web mode:

```
npx nx start my-app
```

### RUN TESTS
1. Run all unit tests and verify success.
```
npx nx run-many -t test
```

### CREATE EXPO DEVELOPMENT BUILD

1. Create an Expo Account:  [Expo Sign Up](https://expo.dev/signup)
2. Remove eas project id.  In the app.config.js, comment out the eas.projectId so it looks like this:
```
  extra: {
    // This is the project ID from the previous step
    // eas: {
    //   projectId: '0b1aa1f3-a7d9-4a39-8bfe-024107fcfbdb',
    // },
  },

``` 
2. Create a build:
```
npx nx build my-app
```
* Email or username: [from the account you created]
* Password: [Your password]
* Select Platform: [Select the one you want]
* Would you like to automatically create an EAS project for @stewartoutlook/my-app? Y

You will get an error because the project uses dynamic app configuration.  Follow the instructions to update the app.config.js file with your expo.extra.eas.projectId property.
```
Warning: Your project uses dynamic app configuration, and the EAS project ID can't automatically be added to it.
https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/#dynamic-configuration-with-appconfigjs

To complete the setup process, set "extra.eas.projectId" in your app.config.js:

{
  "expo": {
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "[your id]"
      }
    }
  }
}
...
```
3. Edit app.config.js using the directions above.
4. Rerun the build:
```
npx nx build-dv my-app
```
5. Install development build by scanning the QR Code

...build this out further...

### RUN DEVELOPMENT BUILD ON PHYSICAL DEVICE
After you have installed the development build.  Run the app:
```
npx nx start my-app
```
Then scan the QR Code with your phone.  The app should be running on your phone.

### DEBUG WEB APP
To debug the web app, just open the browser devTools.
Be sure to install the React Developer Tools and the Redux Developer Tools add ons to help debug the application.

### DEBUG MOBILE APP

#### Debugging Code
1. **Start App:**  Start the app use the instructions for Running the development build on a physical device above.
2. **Open Browswer:**  Open Edge or Chrome and enter ```edge://inspect``` or ```chrome://inspect```
3. **Set Network Targets:** Next to Discover network targets click configure and enter your host machines ip address and the port you started the development build on (ex. 19001)
4. **Inspect Hermes React Native:** Click the 'inspect' link under Hermes React Native shown under remote targets.
5. **Find Code:** To find the code hit Cntrl-P and type in the name of the code file.  //TODO: find a way to load the code into the workspace.
6. **Break Points**: Breakpoints did not work for me.  Instead I added ```debugger;``` into my code to break.

#### Inspecting UI and Performance Tracing (React Dev Tools)
1. **Start App:**  Start the app use the instructions for Running the development build on a physical device above.
2. **Open React Dev Tools:**  Hit Shift+M in the terminal where you started the app to open more tools options.  Select ```Open React devtools``` and then hit enter.  Enter yes to option to open the browser page.
3. **Open the App:** Open the app on your phone.  The browser should then connect to your app and allow you to inspect the UI elements and take performance snapshots.

# NX generated readme...
## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
